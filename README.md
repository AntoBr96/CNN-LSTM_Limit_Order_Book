# CNN-LSTM_Limit_Order_Book
This notebook contains an independently developed Keras/Tensorflow implementation of the CNN-LSTM model for Limit Order Book forecasting originally proposed by Zhang *et al.* (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.03668.pdf). The current implementation was adopted in the paper written by Briola *et al.*(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07319.pdf).

The interested reder can find the original implementation of the model at https://github.com/zcakhaa/DeepLOB-Deep-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Limit-Order-Books/blob/master/jupyter/run_train_represent.ipynb.
